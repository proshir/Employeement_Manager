### Project Description:
I created an Employee-City Management System that allows you to dynamically manage employees in different cities. The system is built using PHP and MySQL for the backend, with a user-friendly frontend designed using Bootstrap. The main features of this project include:

### Dynamic Creation of DIVs:

The system dynamically generates DIVs (or other forms) for each city and employee, based on the data stored in the City, Employee, and Employee2City tables.
### Drag-and-Drop Functionality:

Similar to the example you provided, you can use a drag-and-drop interface to move employees from one city to another, providing an intuitive and efficient way to manage their assignments.
### Database Integration:

The system is integrated with a MySQL database, ensuring that changes made to employee-city assignments are stored persistently.
### Adding and Removing Entities:

You can add or remove cities and employees dynamically, and the system will update the UI accordingly.
### Saving Changes:

When you press the "Save" button, the system updates the Employee2City table in the MySQL database to reflect the new assignments, ensuring data consistency.
### User-Friendly Interface:

The frontend is designed with a clean and user-friendly interface, making it easy to navigate and manage employees and cities.

This project provides a practical solution for managing employee assignments across different cities, and it showcases my skills in PHP, MySQL, and frontend development using Bootstrap.
